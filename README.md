# Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis Project

This is a project based in Pedro Marcelino's code (which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pmarcelino/comprehensive-data-exploration-with-python/notebook)) that uses a dataset from real state market status in California in 2010.\
In this project the goal is to predict which variables (81 in total) are the most correlated with the market price. It consists
of univariable studies, multivariable studies and basic cleaning (soon) in order to handle the missing data.\
Initial assumptions:
- OverallQual, YearBuilt, TotalBsmtSF and GrLivArea are the variables who play an important role (desc. order)
